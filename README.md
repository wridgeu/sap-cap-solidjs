# CAP & SolidJS

Playground Monorepo to learn more about SAP CAP, a bit of SolidJS and maybe even Fiori Elements.

## Ideas, things to do or learn

### Testing

- [ ] [CAP Tests](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/cds-test)
- [ ] [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for [SolidJS](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-testing-library)

### CAP

- [ ] Working with Auth.?
- [ ] Trying out MTA, Bundling/Packaging in general
- [ ] Fiddle with deployment to BAS + HTML5 Repository
- [ ] Fiddling with Fiori Elements in addition to SolidJS

### SolidJS

- [ ] Work with Stores
- [ ] Try embedding UI5 WebComponents
- [ ] Create, Read, Update and Deletion of Todos (KIS)
- [ ] Bundling/Packaging + with CAP

### General

- [ ] Clean up `package.json`, `.gitignore` files
- [X] Add LICENSE file(s)
- [ ] Add and configure scripts

## Repository Setup

After fiddling around a bit, reading some blogs and watching a few videos (like [re>â‰¡CAP](https://sapmentors.github.io/reCAP/)) I think that extracting UIs from the CAP `app`-folder is the right thing to do when not working with UI5 or Fiori Elements.
